# Image processing library

This project was completed during a 72-hour course project. 
It includes a library of functions coded in python allowing to realize image processing, as well as a program to test them.

You will find in this project :
- python files sorted by theme
- the test program
- the program to detect a ball
- a french user's manual

Some functions have also been coded in C but this project has not been finalized. Their code is also available here.

The functions are classified in different categories:
- basic : functions for creating, saving and releasing images, working on color matrices 
- filter : all filters required 
- histo : creation and calculation of histograms (simple, cumulative and dynamic expansion) 
- segmentation : image segmentation function (watershed, region growing, dilation, erosion, quad tree on square image) 
- measures : connectedness (it works in c even if it is weak on python), blaschke, shape calculation (perimeter, area, bounding box, elongation) 
- hsv : RGB to HSV conversion
